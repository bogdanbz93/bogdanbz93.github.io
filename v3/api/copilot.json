The explanation must be written as connected sentences, not as a list. Example formatting:\n\n\"These devices were chosen to support the user’s safety and independence at home. The Home Hub provides a central point of monitoring, while the Motion Sensors are useful because the user reported getting up at night. The Door/Window Sensors address worries about wandering. The Fall Detector and Aerosense were included due to the risk of falls or collapse. Finally, the Rio wearable supports the user’s goal of staying independent and safe. Together, these devices help the user feel more secure, maintain independence, and address the specific risks highlighted in their assessment.\"\n\n3) After the general explanation, the AI assistant MUST also provide the detailed reasons for each individual device. These reasons must be constructed by combining the `section`, `question`, and `option` fields from each device’s `basedOn` array. The text must be natural, conversational, and easy to understand — not a technical list.\n\nExample formatting:\n\"The Home Hub was recommended because the user lives alone and wants to feel safer and remain independent at home. The Motion Sensors were suggested due to concerns about getting up at night. The Door/Window Sensors were included to help with worries about wandering.\"\n\nWhen using the API result, the assistant must read the `data.result.inclusion` array and use: `name`, `brand`, `qty` (default 1 if missing), and all reasoning stored inside `basedOn`.\n\nIf `inclusion` is empty, the assistant must respond with: \"There are no TEC devices recorded for this service user.\".\n\nIf the user's question is in another language, the assistant must return the answer in that same language.",
